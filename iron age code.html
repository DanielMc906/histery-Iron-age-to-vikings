<u><h1>Iron age</h1></u>
<u><h2>Introduction</h2></u>
<p>The Iron Age (about 1200 BCE – 500 CE) saw the widespread use of iron for tools and weapons, replacing bronze. This led to advances in agriculture, warfare, and crafts. The period brought technological and social changes, with powerful empires like the Assyrians and Romans rising. Cultural developments, such as the flourishing of Celtic traditions in Europe, also marked this era. The Iron Age laid important foundations for modern societies.</p>
<u><h2>the first people to use iron</h2></u>
<p>The first people to use iron were likely the Hittites, an ancient civilization based in what is now modern-day Turkey. They are believed to have begun using iron around 1200 BCE. Initially, iron was rare and used for ceremonial or decorative purposes, but the Hittites were among the first to develop techniques for smelting and forging iron on a larger scale. This gave them a military and technological advantage, which contributed to their prominence during the Bronze Age collapse.

Iron usage spread across the Near East, Europe, and Africa as other cultures learned these techniques, marking the beginning of the Iron Age.</p>
