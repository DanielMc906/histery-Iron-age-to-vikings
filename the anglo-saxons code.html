	<u><h1>The Anglo-Saxons</h1></u>
	<u><h2>Introduction</h2></u>
<p>
When the Roman rule in Britain ended in 410 AD, 49 years later in 459 AD the Angles and the Saxons began to invade Britain. Unlike the Romans who like to live in big towns, the Anglo-Saxons prefer to live in small villages. Have you ever thought about what food they ate, and what type of jobs they did?
</p><u><h2>Where did the Anglo Saxons come from?</h2></u><img src="DALL·E 2024-09-19 07.18.46 - A map showing Denmark and the Netherlands, both highlighted for clarity.

<p>The last Roman soldiers left Britain by AD410. New<br> people came to Britain in ships across the North Sea <br>– the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxon age in Britain<br> was from around AD410 to 1066.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of tribes from Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.</li>
<li>The three biggest were the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes.</li>
<li>The land they settled in became known as 'Angle-land', or England.</li>
<li>They brought Germanic languages and new customs and dress.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we use the modern names for the countries they came from,<br> the Saxons were German-Dutch,<br> the Angles were Southern Danish,<br> and the Jutes were Northern Danish<br>They arrived over a number of decades.</p><br>
  <u><h2>What food and drink the Anglo-Saxons had </h2></u><img src="the_anglo_saxons_picture_1.png" width="200" height="200" align="right"><img src="the_anglo_saxons_picture_1.png" width="200" height="200" align="left">
<p>Are you aware that the Anglo-Saxons were mostly vegetarian. Vegetables <br>they ate included onions, garlic, cabbage, turnips,<br> beetroot, parsnips, carrots (Which back then wear white) beans and peas. In addition, they  
ateavailable fruits, cherries, berries, apples and plums. They also turned fruit into alcohol, which they <br>had to drink because the water was often polluted. Their favourite meets were deer and wild boar, and the food was cooked over the fire in the middle of the house. Sometimes the best cuts of meat would go to the Lord (the chief of the village) and the wealthier<br> families.The fire in the house/hall could also cook stews in a large cauldron, smoke would rise up and preserve the fish and meat. In addition, they used salt mined in Worcestershire for preserving food. </p><u><h2>What jobs did the Anglo-Saxons do</h2></u>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons had a range of jobs and roles within their society, reflecting their largely agrarian lifestyle, craftsmanship, and communal needs.

<u><h2>Why did the Anglo-Saxons come to Britain?</h2></u><br>
<p><h3>To fight</h3>
The Anglo-Saxons arrived firstly as warriors employed by the Roman army and then, two generations later, as settlers, to farm the land.<br>
<h3>To farm</h3>
Many Anglo-Saxons came peacefully, to find land to farm. Their homelands in Scandinavia often flooded so it was tough to grow enough food back there.<br>
<h3>To make new homes</h3>
Whole families set sail across the sea in small boats to live in Britain. They brought tools, weapons and farm animals with them and built new villages.</ul>

<u><h2>Sutton Hoo</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3></u>
<p>
Sutton Hoo is a series of burial mounds located near Woodbridge in Suffolk, England. The site became famous for its discovery of an Anglo-Saxon ship burial in 1939, which contained an array of high-status artifacts, including an iconic helmet, a sword, and intricate gold and garnet jewelry. The burial is believed to date back to the early 7th century, around the time of King Rædwald of East Anglia, though the identity of the person buried remains uncertain. Sutton Hoo has revolutionized our understanding of the Anglo-Saxon period and the connections between Britain and the wider European world.</p>

<p>
The Sutton Hoo boat is a key feature of one of the most significant archaeological finds in British history.<br> Discovered in 1939 in Suffolk, England, the Sutton Hoo site revealed a ship burial believed to date back to<br> the early 7th century. The boat, approximately 27 meters long, was found buried in a large mound and<br> served as the final resting place for an Anglo-Saxon king or noble, likely King Rædwald of East Anglia.<br><br>

While no actual boat wood remained due to decomposition, its imprint in the soil along with over 4,000 <br>iron rivets revealed its structure. The burial contained numerous grave goods, including a famous ornate<br> helmet, weapons, armor, and treasure, indicating the wealth and importance of the individual interred there.<br> The Sutton Hoo find has provided valuable insight into Anglo-Saxon culture, early medieval craftsmanship,<br> and the connection between Anglo-Saxon England and other cultures, such as those in Scandinavia.</p>
